            Solid has made its mark on the JavaScript ecosystem. It's a
            flourishing community and we want you to be a part of it. Hackathons
            aren't new to the open-source world, but we're looking to push the
            boundaries of what a hackathon can be and what open-source projects
            can do. More importantly, we want to give you an opportunity to give
            Solid a try. What better reason than to learn something new and
            possibly win prize money!
